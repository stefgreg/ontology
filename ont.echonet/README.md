# ECHONET Ontology

This is the Java source code of the ECHONET (and ECHONET Lite) ontology for ECHONET device objects (Release J, Aug.31 2017 by the ECHONET CONSORTIUM).
The ontology is following the guidelines to construct official ontology for the universAAL platform.

## Getting Started

The .owl and .ttl files are already included in the repository. However they can be generated by running the source code.

### Prerequisites

Maven 
Java (JavaSE 1.8)

### Installing

Simply running "Maven-install" the project to generate ontology files.

  Example by using eclipse (Oxygen with maven plugin installed)
  
  Select project -> right-click -> Run as -> Maven install

The ontology files are located at $target/ontologies folder.

### Remaining problems

1. Enum values for properties are going to support in the next version (hoever, it works without the enums)
2. The class naming is following the english specification of the ECHONET Lite protocol (not so easy to understand without the specification)
